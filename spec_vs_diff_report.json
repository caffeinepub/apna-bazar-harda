  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive green-to-royal-blue color theme replacement across all required component files, CSS, and Tailwind config. All major requirements of REQ-8 appear to be addressed: Navigation, Hero, About, WhyChooseUs, Testimonials, Gallery, Contact, Footer, index.css, and tailwind.config.js have been updated with royal blue OKLCH color values. No green color values are visible in the modified files. The implementation uses deep navy blue for dark section backgrounds (Testimonials, Footer), royal blue for primary elements, and lighter blue variants for hover/accent states. White backgrounds for content sections are preserved.",
